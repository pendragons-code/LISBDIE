# Details:
LISBDIE version 1 consists of 1 spamming method, the replication of the keystrokes and entering it after every message being sent. However, there are some issues with this. You have to type the entire thing out before the code registers the message to be spammed. 
    
LISBDIE version 2 revolves around using other methods such as spamming from the clipboard `ctrl c` + `ctrl v` and entering it repeatedly after.
  
  
   
   # Disclaimer
   This tool is indeed something I created after being bored since my life suddenly became a multi-headed dick hydra that is about to rip my flesh and bones apart. That said, I do not encourage that you create chaos of any form of harm in your social circle.
