# LISBDIE 💪:
  A spam tool made in python using different methods for spamming.  
  To run: `python3 LISBDIE.py`  
 
  
  For power users 👉 👉:  
  Consider editing your aliases in your `.bashrc` and it will run the script when run the alias.  
If you have no idea how that should be done, you just need to add an `alias LISBDIE='python3 LISBDIE.py'`

# Details 🪶:
  LISBDIE version 1 consists of 1 spamming method, the replication of the keystrokes and entering it after every message being sent. However, there are some issues with this. You have to type the entire thing out before the code registers the message to be spammed. 🦹‍♂️
    
   LISBDIE version 2 revolves around using other methods such as spamming from the clipboard `ctrl c` + `ctrl v` and entering it repeatedly after. 💼
   
   Update: as of 5th may 2022,I found time at 00:27 to add v1's features into v2. Hooray! 🤟
  
  
   
   # Disclaimer 🤟:
   This tool is indeed something I created after being bored since my life suddenly became a multi-headed dick hydra that is about to rip my flesh and bones apart 😀. That said, I do not encourage that you create chaos of any form to instill harm within in your social circle. Also if you are curious why the code is so badly written and why it kinda looks like ramen, that's because I was at a coffeeshop near school when I made this and uploaded it here. I was not using an IDE natively on my phone, rather I was using a txt file and then converting it to a python file to make this thing. So yes, it works, but not optimized yet, when I finally have some free time, I may consider optimizing this tool. Do tell me if there are any errors and if you would like me to correct such issues right away if you can. Have a nice day! :P
